# Hi, I'm Cody! 

I'm a Computer and Information Science Dec. 2022 graduate from the University of Michigan-Dearborn.<br>
I thrive most while building frontend design and gaming projects, talking about accessibility, presenting my work to colleagues, and writing all of that technical goodness into my documentation.

## When I'm not coding, I'm:
- Putting my 3D printers to the test with my lowpoly designs.
- Cross stitching, print making, painting, doodling, and other creative pursuits.
- Cooking and baking up a storm in the kitchen.
- Taking part (and succeeding!) in UMD <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/art-in-a-time-of-pandemic/1st-prize/art?authuser=0">photography</a> and <a href="https://umdearborn.edu/casl/departments/language-culture-and-arts/composition-and-rhetoric/writing-awards?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqoibBhDUARIsAH2OpWitjbzNEeqbX3yDkuqo49N606whI-af0_MPpCX9yF0w6o9RL2fcfMsaAiUsEALw_wcB">writing</a> contests.
- Working as an American Sign Language interpreter.
