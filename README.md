# Hi, I'm Cody! 

I'm a Computer and Information Science senior at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, set to graduate in December 2022.<br>
I thrive most while building frontend design projects, talking about web accessibility, presenting my work to colleagues, and in writing all of that technical goodness into my documentation.

# When I'm not coding, I'm:
- Putting my 3D printers to the test with my lowpoly designs.
- Cross stitching, print making, painting, doodling, and everything else my heart desires.
- Cooking and baking up a storm in the kitchen.
- Curating choice <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/12178010763">Spotify</a> playlists.
